ANS:
Internal CSS and External CSS are two techniques for applying styles to HTML texts, each with its own set of benefits and applications.

<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Internal CSS Example</title>
    <style>
        body {
            background-color: lightblue;
        }
        h1 {
            color: navy;
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
        }
        p {
            color: darkslategray;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>

    <h1>Welcome to Internal CSS Example</h1>
    <p>This page uses internal CSS to apply styles.</p>

</body>
</html>
Internal CSS is placed directly within an HTML document. It is defined inside the <style> tag within the <head> section. Internal CSS is useful for styling a single HTML page specifically, without affecting other pages.
